### **_Description_**

The Project Planner App (working title) will allow a user to plan and organize projects of any nature. Be it an art project, building project, cosplay project or anything else that needs planned out.

A user will be able to log in and create new projects which will store information such as a name, description, materials, budget, images, etc. The project details page will contain a section where the user can create one or more checklists to track progress on a project. A user will be able to set a project to be public. The dashboard page will display both the user's projects as cards, as well as any projects that are flagged as public.
